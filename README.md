# handwritten-digit-recognition-problem  
This project was done by @heyimjustalex and me. We solved the problem using KNN, SVM and neural networks algorithms. To train these algorithms we used the train set from
the MNIST database, but to test we created our own test set using Paint (the digits folder). It is noteworthy to mention that the size of the images must be equal to 28x28 pixels.
